#Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours

##Overview


Most Haskell tutorials on the web use a style of teaching akin to language reference manuals. They show you the syntax of the language, a few language constructs, then tell you to create a few simple functions at the interactive prompt. The "hard stuff" of how to write a functioning, useful program is left to the end, or omitted entirely.

>许多网络上Haskell的教程使用了一个语言参考教程的形式教授，他们展示给你的时语言的语法，一个新语言的构造，然后告诉你如何构建一个新的简单函数在interactive prompt上,这种“艰难的东西”如果写一个功能性有用的程序直到结束 或者完全省略



This tutorial takes a different approach. You'll start off using and parsing the command-line, then progress to writing a fully-functional Scheme interpreter that implements a decent subset of R5RS Scheme. Along the way, you'll learn Haskell's I/O, mutable state, dynamic typing, error handling, and parsing features. By the time you finish, you should become fairly fluent in Haskell and Scheme.
